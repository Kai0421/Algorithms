# Algorithms

This contain a list of algorithm example. The first upload is a doubly linked list. Shows an example of how to construct a doubly linked list have the ability to add, remove and find the node. When removing each node, the list will able to resort after the removal process. 

# Sorting Algorithms
List of sorting algorithms construct it using loop and recursion. Shows different ways for performing the sorting algorithms.

Using JUnit to perform testing on each function, and also for each scenario.
